        <p>Hello, my name is David Gómez. I am a former lawyer that is studying to become a web developer since this careeer seems like a very good oportunity in so many different levels and, besides, it looks like a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>This website has the purpose to show the personal projects in which I have worked so people can see my progress and maybe enjoy some of the websites I have build from scratch.</p>
