        I started studying the second semester of 2023 in
        <a href="https://platzi.com/">Platzi</a>, a Latam online university.
        There I learnt a lot with very good professors. Afterwards I got myself
        to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> since I saw that is a
        little better known in the industry and it teaches in English, which I
        think is very important since the programming languages are mostly in
        English.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently finishing my study of
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"
          >Java Script in the front</a
        >
        and afterwards I will study that same langage in the back NodeJS
      </p>

        This time studying I have learnt some visually interesting that can be
        done with the event listeners target and bubbling phases. For instance,
        with only one click you can generate random colors as an echo:
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
        <a href="./playingWithColors/index.html"
          >Click and see the echo of colors through your screen.</a
        >
      </p> -->
