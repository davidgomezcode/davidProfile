        <p>Hello, my name is David Gómez. I am a former <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidg%C3%B3mezvillegas/">lawyer</a> that is studying to become a web developer, since this careeer seems like a very good oportunity in so many different levels and, besides, it looks like a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>This website has the purpose to show the personal projects in which I have worked so people can see my progress and maybe enjoy some of the websites I have build from scratch.</p>

        <p>I started studying the second semester of 2023 in <a href="https://platzi.com/">Platzi</a>, a Latam online university. There I learnt a lot with very good professors. Afterwards I got myself to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> since I saw that is a little better known in the industry and it teaches in English, which I think is very important since the programming languages are mostly in English.</p>

        <p>I am currently finishing my study of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/">Java Script in the front</a>  and afterwards I will study that same langage in the back NodeJS</p>
