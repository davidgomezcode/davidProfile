        I started studying the second semester of 2023 in
        <a href="https://platzi.com/">Platzi</a>, a Latam online university.
        There I learnt a lot with very good professors. Afterwards I got myself
        to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> since I saw that is a
        little better known in the industry and it teaches in English, which I
        think is very important since the programming languages are mostly in
        English.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently finishing my study of
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"
          >Java Script in the front</a
        >
        and afterwards I will study that same language in the back NodeJS

        This time studying I have learnt some visually interesting that can be
        done with the event listeners target and bubbling phases. For instance,
        with only one click you can generate random colors as an echo:

          <p class="gadgetP">See the echo of colors.</p>

      <p>
        This gadget and the next one were build using APIs. The present one is
        the fetching of country data and the display of that data in the
        container below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please write the name of the country and see some of its relevant data
        appear
      </p>
      <article class="countryContainer">
        <!-- Here goes the country the user writes -->
      </article>
      <p>
        Using third parties libraries and relevant new APIs (like the
        geolocation API) I created this map, in which you can pin locations
        where you worked, studied, or made exercise.
      </p>

      <p>
        I added some interesting features, like a button to change from a drawn
        map to a satellite one, a button to immediately locate you and a burger
        menu to have a log of your activities.

            The best toys are the ones that she stole from other dogs or found
