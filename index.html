        I started studying the second semester of 2023 in
        <a href="https://platzi.com/">Platzi</a>, a Latam online university.
        There I learnt a lot with very good professors. Afterwards I got myself
        to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> since I saw that is a
        little better known in the industry and it teaches in English, which I
        think is very important since the programming languages are mostly in
        English.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently finishing my study of
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"
          >Java Script in the front</a
        >
        and afterwards I will study that same langage in the back NodeJS

        This time studying I have learnt some visually interesting that can be
        done with the event listeners target and bubbling phases. For instance,
        with only one click you can generate random colors as an echo:
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
        <a href="./playingWithColors/index.html"
          >Click and see the echo of colors through your screen.</a

        To tell something else about me, I will include some of the pets I or my
        family had have. Meanwhile I will take this as an excuse to show them in
        an slider.

            Here is Nyx watching the park, probably trying to find the toy of
            another dog to steal it.
          </p>
          <p>Or maybe, she is looking at a cat and dying to pursue it.</p>

            She likes to go anywhere, even if its raining and despite some of
            the time having to be semi-still in a café

          <p>Sometimes she is sick and we have to take care of her.</p>
          <p>
            Despite being sick, she continues with the same energy and the same
            motivation to play, which can make taking care of her a little
            difficult.

          <p>
            Playing is what she enjoy the most. It does not matter if it is with
            balls, sticks, other toys or just run around, she just want to
            interact with people
          </p>
          <p>
            The best toys are the ones that she stole from other dogs or found
            abandoned in the floor, or better still, hidden.
